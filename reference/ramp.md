# Create ramp function

Create a ramp function that increases linearly from 0 to a specified
height at a specified start time, and stays at this height after the
specified end time.

## Usage

``` r
ramp(times, start, finish, height = 1)
```

## Arguments

- times:

  Vector of simulation times

- start:

  Start time of ramp

- finish:

  End time of ramp

- height:

  End height of ramp, defaults to 1

## Value

Ramp interpolation function

## Details

Equivalent of Ramp() in Insight Maker

## Examples

``` r
# Create a simple model with a ramp function
sfm <- stockflow() |>
  update("a", "stock") |>
  # Specify the global variable "times" as simulation times
  update("input", "constant", eqn = "ramp(times, 20, 30, 3)") |>
  update("inflow", "flow", eqn = "input(t)", to = "a")


sim <- simulate(sfm, only_stocks = FALSE)
plot(sim)
