# Create or modify variables

Add or change variables in a stock-and-flow model. Variables may be
stocks, flows, constants, auxiliaries, or graphical functions. When
creating new variables, only "name", "type", and "eqn" (initial value
for stocks) are required. When modifying existing variables, only "name"
is required to identify the variable to modify, and any other properties
can be updated by including the corresponding arguments.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'stockflow'
update(
  object,
  name,
  type = NULL,
  eqn = 0,
  label = name,
  doc = "",
  to = NULL,
  from = NULL,
  non_negative = FALSE,
  xpts = NULL,
  ypts = NULL,
  source = NULL,
  interpolation = "linear",
  extrapolation = "nearest",
  df = NULL,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  Stock-and-flow model, object of class
  [`stockflow`](https://kcevers.github.io/sdbuildR/reference/stockflow.md).

- name:

  Variable name. Accepts a bare symbol (e.g., `population`), a string
  (`"population"`), or a vector via
  [`c()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html) (e.g., `c(a, b)` or
  `c("a", "b")`). Use `!!` to inject from a variable.

- type:

  Type of building block(s); accepts a bare symbol or string. One of
  `stock`, `flow`, `constant`, `aux`, `lookup`, or `func`. Does not need
  to be specified to modify an existing variable.

- eqn:

  Equation (or initial value in the case of stocks). Accepts a bare
  expression (e.g., `a * b + 1`), a string (`"a * b + 1"`), or a numeric
  value. Use `!!` to inject from a variable. Defaults to `0`.

- label:

  Name of variable used for plotting. Defaults to the same as name.

- doc:

  Description of variable. Defaults to `""` (no description).

- to:

  Target of flow. Accepts a bare symbol or string. Must be a stock in
  the model. Defaults to `NULL` to indicate no target.

- from:

  Source of flow. Accepts a bare symbol or string. Must be a stock in
  the model. Defaults to `NULL` to indicate no source.

- non_negative:

  If TRUE, variable is enforced to be non-negative (i.e., strictly 0 or
  positive). Defaults to `FALSE`.

- xpts:

  Only for graphical functions: vector of x-domain points. Must be of
  the same length as ypts.

- ypts:

  Only for graphical functions: vector of y-domain points. Must be of
  the same length as xpts.

- source:

  Only for graphical functions: name of the variable which will serve as
  the input to the graphical function. Accepts a bare symbol or string.
  Defaults to `NULL`.

- interpolation:

  Only for graphical functions: interpolation method. Must be either
  "constant" or "linear". Defaults to "linear".

- extrapolation:

  Only for graphical functions: extrapolation method. Must be either
  `"nearest"` or `"NA"`. Defaults to `"nearest"`.

- df:

  A data.frame with variable properties to add and/or modify. Each row
  represents one variable to update. Required columns depend on the
  variable type being created:

  - All types require: 'type', 'name'

  - Stocks require: 'eqn' (initial value)

  - Flows require: 'eqn', and at least one of 'from' or 'to'

  - Constants require: 'eqn'

  - Auxiliaries require: 'eqn'

  - Graphical functions require: 'xpts', 'ypts'

  Optional columns for all types: 'label', 'doc', 'non_negative'
  Optional columns for graphical functions: 'source', 'interpolation',
  'extrapolation'

  Columns not applicable to a variable type should be set to NA. See
  Examples for a complete demonstration.

- ...:

  Additional arguments (currently unused).

## Value

A stock-and-flow model object of class
[`stockflow`](https://kcevers.github.io/sdbuildR/reference/stockflow.md)

## Stocks

Stocks define the state of the system. They accumulate material or
information over time, such as people, products, or beliefs, which
creates memory and inertia in the system. As such, stocks need not be
tangible. Stocks are variables that can increase and decrease, and can
be measured at a single moment in time. The value of a stock is
increased or decreased by flows. A stock may have multiple inflows and
multiple outflows. The net change in a stock is the sum of its inflows
minus the sum of its outflows.

The obligatory properties of a stock are "name", "type", and "eqn".
Optional additional properties are "label", "doc", "non_negative".

## Flows

Flows move material and information through the system. Stocks can only
decrease or increase through flows. A flow must flow from and/or flow to
a stock. If a flow is not flowing from a stock, the source of the flow
is outside of the model boundary. Similarly, if a flow is not flowing to
a stock, the destination of the flow is outside the model boundary.
Flows are defined in units of material or information moved over time,
such as birth rates, revenue, and sales.

The obligatory properties of a flow are "name", "type", "eqn", and
either "from", "to", or both. Optional additional properties are
"label", "doc", "non_negative".

## Constants

Constants are variables that do not change over the course of the
simulation - they are time-independent. These may be numbers, but also
functions. They can depend only on other constants.

The obligatory properties of a constant are "name", "type", and "eqn".
Optional additional properties are "label", "doc", "non_negative".

## Auxiliaries

Auxiliaries are dynamic variables that change over time. They are used
for intermediate calculations in the system, and can depend on other
flows, auxiliaries, constants, and stocks.

The obligatory properties of an auxiliary are "name", "type", and "eqn".
Optional additional properties are "label", "doc", "non_negative".

## Graphical functions

Graphical functions, also known as table or lookup functions, are
interpolation functions used to define the desired output (y) for a
specified input (x). They are defined by a set of x- and y-domain
points, which are used to create a piecewise linear function. The
interpolation method defines the behavior of the graphical function
between x-points ("constant" to return the value of the previous
x-point, "linear" to linearly interpolate between defined x-points), and
the extrapolation method defines the behavior outside of the x-points
("NA" to return NA values outside of defined x-points, "nearest" to
return the value of the closest x-point).

The obligatory properties of a graphical function are "name", "type",
"xpts", and "ypts". "xpts" and "ypts" must be of the same length.
Optional additional properties are "label", "doc", "source",
"interpolation", "extrapolation".

## Non-standard evaluation (NSE)

The `name`, `type`, `eqn`, `to`, `from`, and `source` arguments support
non-standard evaluation. This means you can pass bare symbols and
expressions instead of quoted strings:

    # These are equivalent:
    stock(sfm, "population", eqn = "birth_rate * 0.1")
    stock(sfm, population, eqn = birth_rate * 0.1)

To inject the value of a variable (rather than its name), use the `!!`
(bang-bang) operator from rlang:

    my_name <- "population"
    stock(sfm, !!my_name, eqn = 100)

The `label`, `doc`, `non_negative`, `xpts`, `ypts`, `interpolation`, and
`extrapolation` arguments are not affected by NSE and are evaluated
normally.
