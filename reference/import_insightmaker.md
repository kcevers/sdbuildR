# Import Insight Maker model

Import a stock-and-flow model from [Insight
Maker](https://insightmaker.com/). Models may be your own or another
user's. Importing causal loop diagrams or agent-based models is not
supported.

## Usage

``` r
import_insightmaker(
  url,
  file,
  keep_nonnegative_flow = TRUE,
  keep_nonnegative_stock = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- url:

  URL to Insight Maker model. Character.

- file:

  File path to Insight Maker model. Only used if url is not specified.
  Needs to be a character with suffix .InsightMaker or .json.

- keep_nonnegative_flow:

  If TRUE, keeps original non-negativity setting of flows. Defaults to
  TRUE.

- keep_nonnegative_stock:

  If TRUE, keeps original non-negativity setting of stocks. Defaults to
  FALSE.

## Value

A stock-and-flow model object of class
[`stockflow`](https://kcevers.github.io/sdbuildR/reference/stockflow.md).

## Details

Insight Maker models can be imported using a URL, Insight Maker file, or
ModelJSON file. Ensure the URL refers to a public (not private) model.
To download a model file from Insight Maker, first clone the model if it
is not your own. Then, go to "Share" (top right), "Export", and
"Download Insight Maker file" or "ModelJSON File".
