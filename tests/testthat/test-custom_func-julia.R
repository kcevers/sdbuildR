# R -> Julia mapping of the custom convenience functions.
#
# test-sdbuildR_custom_func.R checks the R implementations, and test-conv_julia.R
# checks the *string* rewrite (e.g. logistic(x, slope = 2) -> logistic.(x, 2.0, ...)).
# Neither checks that the rewritten Julia code, run in the user's Julia package
# (SystemDynamicsBuildR), actually evaluates to the same number as R. That is what
# these tests do: they convert exactly as simulate() would and execute the result
# in the live Julia session, then compare against R.
