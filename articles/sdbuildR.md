# Get started with sdbuildR

``` r

library(sdbuildR)
```

sdbuildR is an R package for building, simulating, and testing
stock-and-flow models. This page gives a quick overview of its main
features.

### Load models from the model library

Dozens of example models can be loaded using
[`stockflow()`](https://kcevers.github.io/sdbuildR/reference/stockflow.md).
Here we load the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model, a classic
model in epidemiology:

``` r

sfm <- stockflow("sir")
print(sfm)
#> 
#> ── Stock-and-Flow Model: Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) ──────────────────
#> 3 stocks • 2 flows • 4 constants
#> 
#> ── Stock-Flow Structure ──
#> 
#> infected: + new_infections - new_recoveries
#> recovered: + new_recoveries
#> susceptible: - new_infections
#> 
#> ── Other Variables ──
#> 
#> Constants: `contact_rate`, `infection_rate`, `recovery_rate`, and
#> `total_population`
#> 
#> ── Simulation Settings ──
#> 
#> Time: 0.0 to 20.0 weeks (dt = 0.01) • euler • R
#> Simulation output: stocks only
```

Plot the stock-and-flow diagram for a structural overview:

``` r

plot(sfm)
```

Simulate and plot the model’s behaviour over time:

``` r

sim <- simulate(sfm)
plot(sim)
```

### Build a model from scratch

The equivalent stock-and-flow model can also be built from scratch. We
initialise an empty model with
[`stockflow()`](https://kcevers.github.io/sdbuildR/reference/stockflow.md)
and add three stocks.

``` r

sfm <- stockflow() |>
  stock(Susceptible, eqn = 99999) |>
  stock(Infected, eqn = 1) |>
  stock(Recovered, eqn = 0)
```

Above, we use the pipe operator `|>` for better legibility. It simply
passes the result of an expression to the next expression as its first
argument.

``` r

plot(sfm)
```

Next, we add two flows that move population from one stock to another:

``` r

sfm <- sfm |>
  flow(New_infections,
    eqn = "Infection_rate * Susceptible * Infected",
    from = "Susceptible", to = "Infected"
  ) |>
  flow(New_recoveries,
    eqn = "Recovery_rate * Infected",
    from = "Infected", to = "Recovered"
  )

plot(sfm)
```

The flows refer to four constants, which still need to be defined:

``` r

sfm <- sfm |>
  constant(Total_population,
    eqn = "Susceptible + Infected + Recovered"
  ) |>
  constant(Contact_rate, eqn = 2) |>
  constant(Recovery_rate, eqn = 0.1) |>
  constant(Infection_rate,
    eqn = "Contact_rate / Total_population"
  )
```

Simulation settings such as the time range and time step (`dt`) are
configured with
[`sim_settings()`](https://kcevers.github.io/sdbuildR/reference/sim_settings.md).

``` r

sfm <- sfm |>
  sim_settings(start = 0, stop = 20, time_units = "weeks") |>
  # Add model name
  meta(name = "Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)")
```

``` r

sim <- simulate(sfm)
plot(sim)
```

See the [Build](https://kcevers.github.io/sdbuildR/articles/build.html)
vignette for a full guide on constructing and modifying models.

### Ensemble simulations

Running multiple simulations (i.e., an ensemble) provides insight into a
model’s behavioural variability. Here, we initialize all stocks to a
random value:

``` r

sfm_ens <- sfm |>
  update(c(Susceptible, Infected, Recovered), eqn = runif(1, 1, 1000)) |>
  # Save fewer values for computational efficiency
  sim_settings(stop = 50, save_at = 1)
```

``` r

sims <- ensemble(sfm_ens, n = 100)
#> Starting ensemble simulation in "R" with 100 simulations.
#> ✔ Ensemble simulation completed in 6.4031 seconds.
plot(sims)
```

Ensemble simulations can be run in parallel in R for speed, or in Julia
for even faster performance.

See the
[Ensemble](https://kcevers.github.io/sdbuildR/articles/ensemble.html)
vignette for more, including varying multiple parameters, parallel
execution, and accessing simulation data.

### Unit tests

Stock-and-flow models can easily become complex, producing unexpected
behaviours as the model is developed. Unit tests assert that a model
behaves as expected. An expression that evaluates to `TRUE` means the
test passes. Here we check that the susceptible population never becomes
negative, and that the total population is conserved:

``` r

sfm <- sfm |>
  unit_test(expr = all(Susceptible >= 0)) |>
  unit_test(
    expr = all(abs(Susceptible + Infected + Recovered - Total_population) < 1e-8),
    label = "Population is conserved"
  )

verify(sfm)
#> 
#> ── Stock-and-Flow Unit Test Results ────────────────────────────────────────────
#> 2/2 tests passed.
#> ✔ 1. Susceptible is at least 0 (for all values)
#> ✔ 2. Population is conserved
```

See the [Unit
tests](https://kcevers.github.io/sdbuildR/articles/unit-tests.html)
vignette for more, including conditional tests, visualizing and
extracting test results, and debugging failed tests.
