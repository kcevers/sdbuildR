# Setting up Julia

``` r

library(sdbuildR)

# Disable WebGL: many plotly widgets per HTML page can exceed the browser WebGL
# context limit and render blank. SVG always renders.
options(sdbuildR.webgl = FALSE)
library(JuliaConnectoR)
```

sdbuildR supports simulating stock-and-flow models with Julia as the
backend. Julia is a modern, open-source programming language that
reaches performance comparable to lower-level languages like C while
maintaining higher-level syntax similar to R and Python. To simulate
with Julia, sdbuildR translates R to Julia code and uses
[`JuliaConnectoR`](https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/JuliaConnectoR/) to
call Julia from R, so that users may benefit from Julia’s computational
speed without interacting with Julia directly.This guide will help you
install Julia and configure it to work with sdbuildR.

## Step 1: Install Julia

Download and install Julia from <https://julialang.org/install/>. If you
already have Julia installed, go to the next step.

We recommend using **juliaup**, Julia’s official version manager, which
makes it easy to install and switch between Julia versions.
Alternatively, you can download a standalone Julia installer from
<https://julialang.org/downloads/>.

## Step 2: Check if Julia is accessible

After installing Julia, try to start a Julia session:

``` r

juliaSetupOk()
#> Starting Julia ...
#> [1] TRUE
juliaEval("1+1")
#> [1] 2
stopJulia()
```

If this throws an error, go to the section Troubleshooting below.

## Step 3: Using Julia with sdbuildR

After installing Julia, you need to set up the Julia environment for
sdbuildR:

``` r

install_julia_env()
```

Note that this may take 10-25 minutes the first time as Julia downloads
and compiles packages.

## Step 4: Verify Julia environment setup

Start a Julia session and activate the Julia environment for sdbuildR:

``` r

use_julia()
#> ℹ Activating Julia environment for sdbuildR at
#>   /home/runner/.local/share/R/sdbuildR/julia...
#> ✔ Julia environment ready.
```

This needs to be done in *each* new R session.

To close the Julia session:

``` r

use_julia(stop = TRUE)
#> ✔ Closed Julia session.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Julia not found

If JuliaConnectoR cannot find Julia, i.e., this evaluates to `FALSE`:

``` r

juliaSetupOk()
#> Starting Julia ...
#> [1] TRUE
```

#### Find your Julia installation path

##### From Julia

If you can start Julia from your terminal/command prompt, run this
inside Julia:

``` julia
Base.julia_cmd()[1]
```

This returns something like:

- Windows:
  `"C:\\Users\\YourName\\.julia\\juliaup\\julia-1.11.3+0.x64.w64.mingw32\\bin\\julia.exe"`
- macOS:
  `"/Applications/Julia-1.11.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia"`
- Linux: `"/usr/bin/julia"`

**Important**: You need the bin directory containing the executable
(remove `julia.exe` or `julia` from the end).

##### From your terminal/command prompt

**Windows:**

``` bash
where julia
```

**macOS/Linux:**

``` bash
which julia
# or
whereis julia
```

Take note of the path, removing the filename to get just the `bin`
directory.

### Add Julia to your PATH permanently

To make Julia accessible to R across all sessions, add it to your
`.Renviron` file.

#### Open .Renviron

Run this in R to open your `.Renviron` file:

``` r

# Install usethis if needed
if (!require("usethis")) install.packages("usethis")

# Open .Renviron for editing
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

This will open `.Renviron` in your text editor. If the file doesn’t
exist, it will be created.

#### Add Julia to PATH

Add one of the following lines to `.Renviron`, replacing the path with
your actual Julia `bin` directory:

**Windows (use forward slashes for the path, semicolon as separator):**

    PATH="C:/Users/YourName/.julia/juliaup/julia-1.11.3+0.x64.w64.mingw32/bin;${PATH}"

**macOS (use `:` as separator):**

    PATH="/Applications/Julia-1.11.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin:${PATH}"

**Linux (use `:` as separator):**

    PATH="/usr/bin:${PATH}"

Replace the path before the separator with your actual Julia `bin`
directory. Be sure to keep `${PATH}` at the end, such that the Julia
path is appended to the PATH.

If using **juliaup** (recommended), you can point to the juliaup
directory instead of a specific version:

**Windows:**

    PATH="C:/Users/YourName/.julia/juliaup;${PATH}"

**macOS/Linux:**

    PATH="~/.julia/juliaup/bin:${PATH}"

This allows **juliaup** to manage which Julia version is used.

#### Save and restart R.

1.  Save the `.Renviron` file
2.  Restart R (Session → Restart R in RStudio, or close and reopen R)

#### If Julia is still not found

JuliaConnectoR tries to find Julia in the following order:

``` r

Sys.getenv("JULIA_BINDIR") # "" if not found

Sys.which("julia") # "" if not found

# On Mac/Linux:
julia_path <- file.path(Sys.getenv("HOME"), ".juliaup", "bin", "julia")
file.exists(julia_path) # FALSE if not found
```

1.  Double-check the path you added to `.Renviron`
2.  Make sure you’re pointing to the `bin` directory, not the Julia
    executable
3.  Make sure you’re using the file path separator appropriate for your
    operating system, which you can find with `.Platform$file.sep`.
4.  Verify you saved `.Renviron` and restarted R
5.  View your current PATH

Check whether your Julia bin directory is in your PATH:

``` r

# View PATH split by separator for readability
paths <- strsplit(Sys.getenv("PATH"), .Platform$path.sep)[[1]]
paths[grepl("julia", paths)]
```

### Managing Julia versions with **juliaup**

Some useful terminal commands are listed below.

``` bash
# See installed versions and current default
juliaup status

# Install latest stable version
juliaup add release

# Install specific version
juliaup add 1.11.3

# Set default version
juliaup default 1.11.3

# Update juliaup and all Julia versions
juliaup update

# Remove a version
juliaup remove 1.10.0

# List all available versions
juliaup list
```

### Removing the Julia environment for sdbuildR

``` r

install_julia_env(remove = TRUE)
```

### Advanced: Using multiple Julia versions

If you have multiple Julia versions installed, the first one found in
your PATH will be used by default.

#### Switch versions with **juliaup**

If using **juliaup**, you can change the default version without
modifying `.Renviron`:

``` bash
# From terminal/command prompt
juliaup default 1.11.3
```

#### Switch versions temporarily

sdbuildR uses your default Julia version. To use a different version:

``` r

Sys.setenv(JULIA_BINDIR = "C:/Users/YourName/.julia/juliaup/julia-1.11.3+0.x64.w64.mingw32/bin")
```

Note: This only affects the current R session and is not permanent.
